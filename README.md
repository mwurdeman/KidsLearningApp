KidsLearningApp
===============
Project Overview: This project is an android mobile app that I'm creating for my kids.  They love to play different games on my Nexus 7 but unfortunately alot of them are basic or have pay walls in them.  The general idea of this app is to facilitate basic math, reading, and grammer learning in a 4 year old.
